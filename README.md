# barCode
This project's main purpose is to read any and every QR-Code presented to the camera,
Once a QR-Code is decoded it will extract the result into the console.

My sole purpose in choosing this project relates to the past traumas of the world,
we faced a seemingly never-ending pandemic of Covid-19 and to counter the spread of this virus... the world moved 
to contactless.
                      Whether that be contactless payments or verification of identites, the world had to adapt to 
to new techniques of defence against the virus. I instantly gravitated to choosing this project out of many others, as QR code readers have become one of the most used pieces of programming on a day to day basis. Businesses relied heavily on QR Code readers during the pandemic and continue to do so whether that be through directing customers to promotional items or maintaining protecting customers and staff from the virus.

Every company will depend on a Bar Code Reader.

This program involves the libraries from 
* 'The Processing Foundation's - GStreamer based video library'
* 'Daniel Shiffman's - QR Code'
